# Flashcard App
A Thinkful capstone project culminating frontend development knowledge such as Bootstrap, React, React Hooks, and HTML into a useful study tool.

## Installation
1. Download the files, upzip, and open in your code editor.
2. From the command line, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
3. This command will start two servers concurrently: the API server from 'json-server' and the React application.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this capstone, I personally wrote the code for:
1. React components
2. Creating routes using React Router
3. Using React hooks
4. Using setState() function appropriately
